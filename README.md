### About Me 

Senior Software Engineer specializing in high-performance systems, distributed service architecture, and backend infrastructure. I'm passionate about building efficient, resilient platforms using Rust, C, and Go. My current focus is developing corporate-grade tools for microservice ecosystems — systems that handle scale, security, and observability from the ground up.

### Current Projects 

Microservice Mesh Sidecar (Rust)  
A lightweight, high-performance sidecar proxy for secure service-to-service communication  
- Built-in observability, retries, and circuit breaking  
- Minimal overhead using async Rust (Tokio + Hyper)  
- WASM filter support for custom routing logic  

Smart API Gateway (Rust)  
Edge layer for internal/external APIs with built-in auth and traffic shaping  
- JWT authentication, rate limiting, and quota enforcement  
- Dynamic routing and GraphQL passthrough support  
- Integrates with Redis and OpenTelemetry  

Distributed Message Broker (C)  
Pub/Sub system for ultra-low-latency microservice messaging  
- Supports multiple delivery guarantees (at-least-once, exactly-once)  
- Binary protocol for fast serialization  
- Log-based message replay and partitioning  

Config Management Service (Rust)  
Centralized config registry for live-reload and access control  
- Real-time config propagation  
- Fine-grained RBAC  
- gRPC and REST API interfaces

### Collaboration Interests

I’m open to working on:  
- Rust-based microservice platforms  
- High-throughput, low-latency systems  
- Custom service mesh or gateway design  
- Distributed tracing or monitoring agents  
- Scalable internal tooling and devops infra

---

### Current Focus 

Actively building microservice infrastructure components that blend performance, reliability, and developer usability. Focused on writing systems in Rust and C that can serve internal enterprise teams and cloud-native platforms at scale.

### Fun Fact 

I’m always chasing the next 10x optimization. Whether it’s shaving off latency in a hot path or replacing bloated layers with lean systems code, I believe performance is a feature — and I love building tools that prove it.
